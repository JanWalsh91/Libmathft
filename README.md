# Libmathft - my own math library

For some projects in the graphics branch at school, I felt it was necessary to make my own library of math functions, since we are often forbidden from using external libraries.
The most extensive part of this library was vector and matrix handling functions.

Should you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to send me an email at jwalsh@student.42.fr.
